        <h1>Snake Body Lab</h1>
        <h2>Special Snake Features</h2>
        <p>Snakes have been slithering around Earth for over 100 million years—long before humans ever showed up! These
            amazing reptiles come in all shapes and sizes, from tiny threadsnakes that can fit on a pencil to giant
            anacondas as long as a school bus. They live almost everywhere in the world, from scorching deserts to deep
            oceans.</p>
        <p>One of the coolest things about snakes is their unique body structure. Unlike us, snakes don't have legs or
            arms. Instead, they have a long, flexible body covered in scales that help them move smoothly through their
            environment. Their backbone is made up of many small bones called vertebrae, which give them incredible
            flexibility and strength.</p>
        <p>Snakes also have some fascinating adaptations that make them expert hunters. Here are some key features of
            snake anatomy:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Scales</dt>
            <dd>Snakes are covered in scales that protect their skin and help them move. The scales can be smooth or
                keeled (ridged), and they come in a variety of colors and patterns that help with camouflage.</dd>
            <dt>Jacobson's Organ</dt>
            <dd>Snakes use their forked tongues to "smell" the air. They flick their tongues in and out to collect scent
                particles, which they then analyze using a special organ called the Jacobson's organ located in the roof
                of their mouth.</dd>
            <dt>Heat-Sensing Pits</dt>
            <dd>Some snakes, like pit vipers, have special heat-sensing pits on their faces that allow them to detect
                warm-blooded prey even in complete darkness.</dd>
            <dt>Venom Glands</dt>
            <dd>Venomous snakes have glands that produce venom, which they use to immobilize or kill their prey. The
                venom is delivered through specialized fangs when the snake bites.</dd>
            <dt>Flexible Jaw</dt>
            <dd>Snakes have incredibly flexible jaws that allow them to swallow prey much larger than their head. Their
                lower jaw is not fused at the chin, enabling them to stretch it wide open.</dd>
            <dt>Muscular Body</dt>
            <dd>Snakes rely on strong muscles to move. They use different types of locomotion, such as lateral
                undulation (side-to-side movement), rectilinear (straight-line movement), and concertina (accordion-like
                movement) to navigate various terrains.</dd>
            <dt>Glottis</dt>
            <dd>The glottis is a small opening in the snake's throat that allows it to breathe while swallowing large
                prey. It can extend outwards, ensuring the snake can continue to get air even when its mouth is full.
            </dd>
            <dt>Spectacle</dt>
            <dd>Snakes don’t have eyelids. Instead, their eyes are covered by a clear scale called a spectacle, which
                protects the eye and keeps it from drying out.</dd>
            <dt>Cloaca</dt>
            <dd>The cloaca is a single opening near the base of the tail used for waste, laying eggs or giving birth,
                and reproduction.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Big Belly: Body Expansion</h2>
        <p>Once their prey is inside, a snake’s body needs to make room. Their stretchy skin and flexible
            <strong>vertebrae</strong> (the
            bones in their backbone) allow their body to expand, turning them into a living “lump conveyor belt” as the
            meal slowly moves down toward the stomach.
        </p>

        <h2>How Snakes Move</h2>
        <p>Even though they don’t have legs, snakes are amazing movers! They can twist, turn, climb, swim, and slither
            in ways that would be impossible for most animals. Snakes use their strong, flexible muscles and hundreds of
            tiny belly scales to grip the ground, push themselves forward, or even climb straight up trees.</p>
        <p>They can travel in several different ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Straight-line crawling:</strong> Some snakes use their belly muscles to move forward in a
                smooth, straight line, almost like a conveyor belt.</li>
            <li><strong>Bunching and stretching:</strong> Other snakes bunch up their body, then stretch it out again to
                pull themselves forward—kind of like an accordion.</li>
            <li><strong>Looping and sidewinding:</strong> On slippery sand or loose dirt, some snakes throw parts of
                their body into loops and “toss” themselves sideways in a special move called sidewinding.</li>
            <li><strong>Swimming:</strong> Freshwater and sea snakes use powerful side-to-side movements to glide
                through the water. Sea snakes even have paddle-shaped tails that act like boat oars to help them swim
                faster.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Cold-Blooded and Cozy</h2>
        <p>Snakes are <strong>ectothermic</strong>, or cold-blooded, which means they can’t make their own body heat
            like
            mammals and birds. Instead, they rely on their environment to stay warm. When it’s chilly, snakes will
            bask in the sun to soak up heat. When it’s too hot, they’ll seek shade or burrow underground to cool off.
            This is why you often see snakes out on sunny rocks or roads in the early morning or late afternoon.</p>


        <h2>Scaly Suits and Shedding</h2>
        <p>Snakes are covered in tough, protective scales that help them move and keep their skin from drying out. As
            snakes grow, they need to shed their old skin to make way for a new, larger one. This process is called
            <strong>molting</strong>
            or <strong>shedding</strong>. Before shedding, a snake’s skin may look dull or cloudy, and its eyes might
            appear
            bluish. When it’s time to shed, the snake will rub against rough surfaces to help peel off the old skin,
            revealing a shiny new layer underneath.
