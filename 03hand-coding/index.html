        <h2>Welcome to the World of Snakes!</h2>
        <p>These incredible creatures have been slithering across the planet for millions of years, and today they can
            be found almost everywhereâ€”from deserts and jungles to backyards and gardens. Snakes come in all shapes,

        <h2>Why Learning About Snakes Matters</h2>
        <p>Understanding snakes is essential for both conservation efforts and personal safety. Many snake species are
            threatened by habitat loss, climate change, and human activities. By learning about these reptiles, we can
            better appreciate their role in nature and take steps to protect them. Additionally, knowing how to identify
            venomous versus non-venomous snakes can help prevent unnecessary fear and promote coexistence. For more
