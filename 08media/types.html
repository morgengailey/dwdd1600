        <h1>Venom vs. Muscle</h1>
        <p>Snakes have developed amazing ways to survive and hunt. While some snakes use <strong>venom</strong> to
            subdue their prey, others rely on <strong>muscle power</strong> to get the job done. These two
            strategies—venomous snakes and constrictors—show just how diverse and fascinating snakes can be.</p>
        <h2>Venomous Snakes</h2>
        <p>Venomous snakes don’t need to chase their prey for long. Instead, they use special glands and fangs to inject
            venom—a powerful chemical that can stop or weaken another animal. Once bitten, the prey becomes unable to
            escape, making it easy for the snake to eat.</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Examples of Venomous Snakes:</dt>
            <dd><strong>Cobras:</strong> Known for their hood and deadly venom.</dd>
            <dd><strong>Rattlesnakes:</strong> Recognizable by the rattle on their tail, they use venom to hunt small
                animals.</dd>
            <dd><strong>Vipers:</strong> These snakes have long, hinged fangs that deliver venom deep into their prey.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt>How Venom Works:</dt>
            <dd>Venom can affect the nervous system, blood, or tissues of the prey, depending on the type of snake. This
                makes it easier for the snake to catch and eat its meal.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt>Fun facts:</dt>
            <dd>Some venomous snakes can control how much venom they inject, using just enough to subdue their prey
                without wasting it.</dd>
            <dd>Venomous snakes often have bright colors or patterns to warn predators to stay away.</dd>
            <dd>Different species have different kinds of venom—some affect nerves, others affect blood</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Constrictors</h2>
        <p>Constrictors are snakes that use their strong muscles to wrap around and squeeze their prey until it can’t
            breathe. These snakes don’t have venom, so they rely on their physical strength to catch and eat their food.

            <dt>Examples of Constrictors:</dt>
            <dd><strong>Boas:</strong> These snakes are known for their size and strength, often found in tropical
                regions.</dd>
            <dd><strong>Pythons:</strong> Some of the largest snakes in the world, they can take down big prey like deer
                and pigs.</dd>
            <dd><strong>King Snakes:</strong> Non-venomous and known for their ability to eat other snakes, including
                venomous ones.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt>How Constriction Works:</dt>

            <dd>Constrictors grab prey with their jaws, wrap around with coils, and squeeze before swallowing whole</dd>

        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt>Fun facts:</dt>
            <dd>Constrictors don’t crush bones; they mainly stop breathing and blood flow</dd>
            <dd>Some constrictors, like the green anaconda, can grow to be over 20 feet long!</dd>
            <dd>Constrictors often have camouflaged patterns that help them blend into their surroundings while hunting.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Other Snakes</h2>
        <p>Not all snakes fit neatly into the venomous or constrictor categories. Some snakes have unique hunting
            methods that combine elements of both strategies or use entirely different techniques.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Examples of Other Snakes:</dt>
            <dd><strong>Garter Snakes:</strong> These snakes are non-venomous and use quick strikes to catch small prey
                like fish and amphibians.</dd>
            <dd><strong>Sea Snakes:</strong> Many sea snakes are venomous, but they have adapted to life in the water,
                using their tails to swim and hunt fish.</dd>
            <dd><strong>King Snakes:</strong> These snakes are non-venomous and known for their ability to eat other
                snakes, including venomous ones.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt>Unique Hunting Methods:</dt>
            <dd>Some snakes use a combination of venom and constriction, while others rely on speed and agility to catch
                their prey.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt>Fun facts:</dt>
            <dd>Some snakes, like the hognose snake, play dead to avoid predators instead of using venom or
                constriction.</dd>
            <dd>Snakes have a wide range of diets, from insects and small mammals to birds and eggs.</dd>
            <dd>Some harmless snakes copy the bright colors of venomous ones to scare predators.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>Recap: Venom vs. Muscle</h2>

        <p>Both venomous snakes and constrictors have evolved incredible ways to hunt and survive. Venomous snakes use
            their chemical weapons to quickly immobilize prey, while constrictors rely on their physical strength to
            overpower. Some snakes don’t use venom or squeezing—they just grab small animals and swallow them whole.
            Each method has its own advantages, showing just how adaptable and diverse snakes can be in the
            wild.</p>
