            <dd>A collection of old stories that people used to explain the world around them. </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Snakes as Symbols of Healing and Life</h3>
        <p>In many places, snakes were seen as creatures connected to healing and new beginnings. This is because snakes
            shed their old skin and grow a shiny new one, almost like they’re being “reborn.” </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In Hindu mythology, snakes are linked to eternity and the continuous cycle of life, because the giant
                serpent Shesha holds up the universe with its endless coils.</li>
            <li> In African cultures, snakes are linked to fertility (the ability to make new life) and farming, because
                people noticed snakes coming out after rain.</li>
            <li>In Native American stories, snakes represent change and transformation because of their skin shedding.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Snakes as Protectors and Powerful Beings </h3>

                with cobras to show their power.</li>
            <li>In Chinese culture, the snake is one of the twelve zodiac animals and is admired for being wise,
                mysterious, and clever.</li>
            <li>In Mesoamerica (Aztecs and Mayans), a god called Quetzalcoatl was pictured as a giant feathered serpent.

                let go, people believed the world would end in chaos.</li>
            <li>In the Bible’s story of Adam and Eve, a snake tempts Eve to eat fruit from the forbidden tree, leading
                to trouble for humans.</li>
